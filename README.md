For as long as monitoring tools have existed, theyâ€™ve relied on manually defined contexts and static thresholds. The way we build infrastructure and write software has changed multiple times in this period, each changing the way we write software. With the introduction of AI we are seeing the first major reshaping of monitoring UX.

This collection of prototypes simulates the experience of creating alerts using:
- static thresholds
- forecasts
- anomalies

And prototypes of algorithmic event feeds and machine learning-driven alerts.
